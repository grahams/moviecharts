I obviously know there's a bit of controversy over my #2, but after seeing TLW again tonight I feel even firmer about my rankings.  TLW is a great concert, but as a film it is kind of puzzling.

This combined with some real other curious choices, like some visible zooms and editing including the artifice of interviews makes me wonder what Scorcese was thinking.
